# Quixx
A Quixx engine for 2 players in Python 
Currently both strategies are set to a random strategy (see player decision in strategies.py)
Run QuixxBatch after setting the number of games you would like to play. Change player_names in QuixxBatch to match the name of your strategy function in strategies.py. This is the initial attempt, please clean up implimentation where it makes sense to.
